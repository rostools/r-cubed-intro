Reproducibility and open scientific practices are increasingly required
of scientists and researchers. We as researchers are also facing more
challenging and complex analyses for larger and larger datasets. Nor do
we receive the necessary support and training on how to do these
analyses and apply these open and reproducible practices. This workshop
will introduce many of the core concepts and practices for doing
reproducible and open data analysis to get you familiar with and
prepared for the type of work needed in research now and in the future.
We use a very practical approach based largely on code-along sessions
(instructor and learner coding together), hands-on exercises, reading
activities, and a group project.

This workshop lasts 3 days and is split into the following sessions
listed in the [schedule](/overview/schedule.qmd).

## Learning outcome and objectives

The overall aim of this workshop is to enable you to:

1.  Describe the fundamentals of what an open and reproducible data
    analysis looks like and then create a project that applies some of
    the basics of these concepts using R.

Broken down into specific objectives for each session, we've designed
the workshop to enable you to do the following:

1.  Explain what an open and reproducible data analysis workflow is,
    what it looks like, and why it is important.

2.  Explain and demonstrate why [R](https://www.r-project.org/) is
    rapidly becoming the standard program of choice for doing modern
    data analysis in science.

3.  Demonstrate and apply collaborative tools and techniques when
    working in team settings (including working with your future self).

4.  Show and apply the fundamental tools and skills for conducting a
    reproducible and modern analysis for a research project, focusing on
    the basics of wrangling and visualizing data, writing reproducible
    reports, and structuring projects.

5.  Show where to go to get help and to continue learning modern data
    analysis skills.

Tangibly, during the workshop you will:

-   Use [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) to write
    and run R code.
-   Use the `{tidyverse}` bundle of R packages to wrangle and visualize
    data.
-   Use the [Git](https://git-scm.com/) interface in RStudio to track
    changes to your files.
-   Use [GitHub](https://github.com/) to store the Git "repository"
    (folder) to collaborate and share with others.
-   Use [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) to write reproducible documents.

Because learning and coding is ultimately not *just* a solo activity, in
addition to the group project work, during this workshop we also aim to
provide opportunities to chat with fellow participants, learn about
their work and how they do analyses, and to build networks of support
and collaboration.

The workshop will place particular emphasis on research in diabetes,
health, and metabolism; it will be taught by instructors working in this
field and it will use relevant examples where possible.
