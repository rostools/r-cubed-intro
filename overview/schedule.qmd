# Schedule {#sec-schedule}

The workshop is structured as a series of participatory live-coding
sessions interspersed with hands-on exercises and group work, using
either a practice dataset or some other real-world dataset. There are
some lectures given, mainly at the start and end of the workshop. The
general schedule outline is shown in the below table. This is not a
fixed schedule of the timings of each session---some may be shorter
and others may be longer. Instead, it is meant to be an approximate
guide and overview.
