# Survey {#sec-survey}

If you haven't read the sections under "Workshop overview" and completed
the "Pre-workshop tasks", **please read them now**.

You're almost done! Please fill out the pre-workshop survey to finish
this section. One of the questions of the survey will ask you to copy
and paste the output of the `r3::check_setup()` function that you ran in
@sec-setup-git-and-github. You can run it again in the Console (panel "B"
in @fig-rstudio-introduction) by copying and pasting the code below:

```{r run-check-setup-again}
#| filename: "Console"
#| eval: false
r3::check_setup()
```

Enter into the survey with the button below and eventually paste the
output from above into one of the questions.
