In order to participate in this workshop, you must complete everything
in this pre-workshop section and finish with **completing the
[survey](/pre-workshop/survey.qmd)** at the end. These tasks are meant
to provide everyone with the necessary setup and a shared foundation for
the workshop.

Depending on your prior knowledge and skills, these tasks could take
between **3-5 hrs to finish**, so we suggest planning some time to
complete them. While many of the tasks are mostly readings, they are
important in making sure you get the most out of the workshop.

Your institution might have special rules or policies around how and if
you can install software on work computers. So you also might have to
contact IT *very early* to make sure everything is properly installed
and setup.

## Summary of tasks

Here's a quick overview of the tasks you need to do. Specific details
about them are found as you work through the tasks. Most of the time
spent on the tasks is on the reading tasks. We include these reading
tasks to have you as aware and as well-prepared as we can before the
workshop, so that we have a smoother start and so that you benefit more
from the improved learning from the earlier and repeated exposure.

Depending on your institution, the installation tasks may require IT
approval. This can take some time, sometimes a few weeks even with
reminder emails. We suggest starting the tasks early, especially the
installation tasks.

Aside from waiting for IT approval, these tasks should take between
**3-5 hrs to finish**, so we suggest planning a full day to complete
them.

1.  Read the learning objectives in
    @sec-pre-workshop-learning-objectives for the pre-workshop tasks
    (below on this page).
2.  Read about how to read this website in @sec-reading-website (below
    on this page).
3.  Do some reading tasks in @sec-pre-reading.
4.  Install the necessary programs and the right versions of those
    programs in @sec-install-programs. As mentioned in the callout block
    above, depending on your institution, this task can take the
    **longest amount of time** because you have to contact your IT to
    install these packages.
5.  Read about and navigate R and RStudio in @sec-r-and-rstudio.
6.  Install necessary R packages in @sec-installing-r-packages. This may
    also require IT approval, so start early.
7.  Read some of the workshop sections on Git, configure Git on your
    computer, and create a GitHub account in @sec-setup-git-and-github
    as well as run some checks to make sure everything is working.
    You'll need to paste this output into the survey later on.
8.  Read through the Code of Conduct in @sec-code-of-conduct.
9.  Complete the pre-workshop [survey](survey.qmd) in @sec-survey. This
    survey is pretty quick, maybe \~10 minutes. There will be some bits
    from the tasks that you will need to paste into this survey.

## Learning objective {#sec-pre-workshop-learning-objectives}

Most of the description of the workshop is in the syllabus that is found
in @sec-syllabus. While you may have signed up to this workshop to learn
more about R, you should know that conducting reproducible research goes
beyond R and RStudio. Which means we will be spending time using other
tools that you will use with R so that you can improve the
reproducibility of your research. This workshop is designed to introduce
you to doing reproducible research while using R.

In general, these pre-workshop tasks are meant to help prepare you for
the workshop and make sure everything is setup properly so the first
session runs smoothly. While most of these pre-workshop tasks are meant
to prepare you for the workshop, some of them are also designed for
learning purposes to enable you to:
