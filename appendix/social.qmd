# Networking and social activities

## Day 1 {#social-day-1 .unnumbered}

After lunch, get together with people from your table during the
workshop and walk outside (or inside). Think about, discuss, and share
with each other these general questions:

-   How do you organise your files and folders for projects? How do you
    manage the different versions and changes to those files, like a
    paper or report? Do you feel content and happy with that system? Do
    you have any tensions or frictions with it?

-   Have you ever written a document that includes an analysis of some
    type, maybe with results or figures? How did you include them in the
    document? Is that an enjoyable or frustrating experience? What were
    some frictions or challenges?

## Day 2 {#social-day-2 .unnumbered}

After lunch, get together with people from your table and walk outside
(or inside). Think about, discuss, and share with each other these
general questions:

-   Have you ever collaborated with others on a project? How did you do
    it? How was that experience? Was it enjoyable and easy to
    contribute? What were some frictions or challenges?

-   Have you ever sent a document to be reviewed by others? How did you
    manage the comments you got back? How did you update the document
    with those comments? How was that experience? Was it enjoyable or
    frustrating? What were some frictions or challenges?
