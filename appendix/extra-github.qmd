# Extras: Manually create a GitHub repo {#sec-extra-github}

This is a short guide on how to manually create a GitHub repository,
starting from the GitHub interface rather than from RStudio.

Open up GitHub in a browser and make sure you are logged in. Create a
new repository by clicking the `+` symbol at the top right to open a
menu and selecting the "New repository" item.

You'll be sent to a screen with some options for the new repository. In
this new page, type out a name for the new repository under "Repository
name". For this guide, you can type out `learning-github` as a name for
the repository and leave everything else blank. If you want, you can set
the repository to "Private" under the "Configurations" section in
"Choose visibility".

Ok, we now have a remote (GitHub) repository to work with. The next step
depends on whether you have an existing repository with a history or you
are starting completely from new. If you haven't created a Git
repository and saved to its history locally, the easiest way of getting
your GitHub repository onto your computer as a local repository is to
download it (or to "clone" it in Git terms).

You can "clone" a GitHub repository easily from RStudio's "Create
Project from Version Control" interface. Go to RStudio and click the
"File" menu on the top menu bar. Under the "File" menu, click "New
Project...", then select "Version Control", then "Git". In the next
screen, paste your repository URL (copied from your repository page on
GitHub) into the "Repository URL" box. Don't change the name of the
project in the "Project directory name". Select the "Browse..." button
next to the "Create project as subdirectory of" box and choose to save
the project to your `Desktop/` folder (or another folder if you want).
Finally, click the "Create Project" button.

::: callout-note
If you created a private GitHub repository, you will need to
authenticate with GitHub. Depending on your setup, your computer may
already be authenticated with GitHub, or you may need to set it up. We
cover authenticating with GitHub in @sec-github.

You now have a local copy of the manually created GitHub repository on
your computer! :tada:
