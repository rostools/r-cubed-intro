Title: "r-cubed: An Introductory Workshop on Modern Data Analyses and Workflows 
    for Reproducible Research in R"
Description: Reproducibility and open scientific practices are increasingly demanded of
    scientists and researchers. Training on how to apply these practices in data
    analysis has not kept up with demand. The aim of this course is to begin meeting
    that demand. The course is designed as a series of participatory live-coding lessons, 
    where the instructor and learner code together, interspersed with hands-on
    exercises throughout the course, 
    and where participants complete a final group assignment doing a simple data analysis project.
    This repository contains all of the
    material for the course, from reading material to exercises to images. It is
    structured as a book, with "chapters" as lessons. For
    more detail on the course, check out the <a href='https://r-cubed-intro.rostools.org'>website</a>.
