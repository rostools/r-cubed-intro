1.  Describe and list some features of the "Grammar of Graphics"
    approach to creating plots, and connect that to how `{ggplot2}`
    works.
2.  Identify ways to present your figures in an output document by using
    Quarto chunk options.
3.  Explain why some commonly used graphs in science are inappropriate
    to use for certain data, like the barplot with mean and standard
    error.
4.  Use the `geom_point()` and `geom_smooth()` functions to create a
    scatterplot of two continuous variables, or `geom_bar()` for showing
    counts of discrete variables.
5.  Explain the importance of writing readable code that follows a
    consistent style guide and use the `{styler}` package to help with
    that.
