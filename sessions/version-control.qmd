**Session objectives**:

<!-- TODO: Revise objectives to fit how I did it in advanced -->

1.  Learn about "formal" version control and its importance.
2.  Learn about Git for version control and apply RStudio's integrated
    Git tools.
3.  Learn and apply the basic workflow of Git version control: View
    changes to files, record and save those changes to a history.

## Instructor note

Before starting this session, get them to share some of the things they
discussed during the social activity.

They will have already read it once before, during the pre-course tasks.
Tell them that they'll read it again to refresh their memories and
reinforce the concepts. This is important because Git and version
control is something that is *very* difficult to conceptually understand
and takes some time and practice.

For the reading parts, let them read it first and then walk through the
material again, to reinforce the importance of version control and doing
it formally. So give them a heads up that you'll be repeating things,
specifically to reinforce the concepts.

It's important in this session to go **slowly**. Version control is a
challenging topic and isn't something most people have ever learned
about or dealt with. So take it slow and make sure everyone is on the
same page. Make use of stickies frequently to assess how everyone is
doing.

!['Final' version of a document, using a common but manual 'version
control
system'.](../images/version-control.jpg){#fig-version-control-comics}

![File naming used in the commonly used 'version
control'.](../images/informal-version-control.jpg){#fig-filenaming-version-control-comics}

Does this way of saving files and keeping track of versions look
familiar? While the above images are teasing a bit, there is truth to
it: It is the most commonly used "version control".

This form of version control, while common, is fairly primitive,
informal, and very manual. It isn't ideal because it requires making
multiple copies of the same file, even if changes are made to only one
small part of the file. This approach also makes it difficult to find
specific changes.

There are, however, formal version control systems that automatically
manage changes to a file or files. These formal version control systems
take snapshots of changes done to files, which are usually called
"revisions" or "commits". These "commits" record what was changed since
the previous "commit". When you make these "commits", you have to create
a short message on what or why you made a change. These "commits" and
their messages are stored as a log entry in a history. This history then
has all this information, for each commit, on which file or files were
changed, what was changed within the file(s), who changed it, and a
short message about the change. This is extremely useful, especially
when working in teams, or for yourself 6 months in the future (because
you *will* forget things), since you can go back and quickly see what
happened and why.

To understand how incredibly powerful version control is, think about
these questions:

-   How many files of different versions of a manuscript or thesis do
    you have laying around after getting feedback from your supervisor
    or co-authors?
-   Have you ever wanted to experiment with your code or your manuscript
    and need to make a new file so that the original is not modified?
-   Have you ever deleted something and wish you hadn't?
-   Have you ever forgotten what you were doing on a project, or why you
    chose a particular strategy or analysis?

All these problems can be fixed by using formal version control! There
are so many good reasons to use version control, especially in science:

-   Transparency of work done to demonstrate or substantiate your
    scientific claim.
-   Claim to first discovery, since you have a time-stamped history of
    your work.
-   Defense against fraud, because of the transparency.
-   Evidence of contributions and work, since who does what is tracked.
-   Keeping track of changes to files easily, by looking at the history
    of changes.
-   Easy collaboration, because you can work on a single file/folder
    rather than emailing versions around.
-   Organized files and folders, since there is one single project
    folder and one single version of each file, rather than multiple
    versions of the same file.
-   Less time finding things, because everything is organized and in one
    place.

In this session we'll be covering a version control tool called
[Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-What-is-Git%3F).
While Git on its own can be quite difficult to use, RStudio thankfully
has an amazing and straight-forward integration to it.
:::

## What is Git? {#sec-what-is-git}

::: callout-note
## Reading task: \~5 minutes

Git is one of several version control system tools available. It was
developed to help software programmers to develop and manage their work
on [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux) (an operating system
like Mac or Windows). Sadly, it was designed by and for software
programmers and not for non-programming users like us researchers. So
why do we teach it? Because Git has so many great features that fit with
how science and data analysis is done.

-   Like R, it is open source, so it's free and anyone verify how
    trustworthy and correct the code is.
-   It is very popular and so has a very large online community that
    provides support, documentation, and tutorials on how to use it.
-   The vast majority of open source projects and work, such as making R
    packages, are done using Git and are hosted on
    [GitHub](https://github.com/), which is a company that hosts Git
    "repositories" (i.e. projects) online.
    -   All RStudio code and `{tidyverse}` packages are on GitHub.
-   There are many open scientific projects that use Git and are hosted
    on GitHub, e.g. [rOpenSci](https://github.com/ropensci) organization
    or [MRC Integrated Epidemiology Unit](https://github.com/MRCIEU).
-   RStudio has an amazing interface and integration with Git.

While learning Git and version control can be difficult and has a steep
learning curve, like learning R, it is ultimately an investment into
your future productivity and effectiveness as a researcher. It is *very
much worth it* to learn and use it as often as you can.

While many people may use Git to manage their R scripts, you can also
manage other non-code based files like Word or images in Git. Version
control is useful for any project that uses any type of files since they
can be saved in the Git history (though there are some limitations to
using Git for files that are not plain text like R scripts are). You can
save files either by adding and committing them (as we will learn to do
shortly) or by uploading them to your repository on GitHub, as pictured
below.

## Basics of Git {#sec-basics-of-git}

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal" collapse="true"}
## Instructor note

Just like above, they've already read this section but should read it
again to reinforce the concepts. Briefly go over it again, especially
making sure everyone has their Git properly configured. Even though they
do that already during the pre-course tasks, sometimes things happen in
the meantime, so its good to check again.

## Reading task: \~8 minutes

Git works by tracking changes to files *at the project level* (i.e. for
every R Project). So you won't track your entire, for instance,
`Documents/` folder. When file changes are saved and put into the
history, this history is called a "repository" (also called a "repo" for
short). We'll explain more about what a repository is later. What you do
with Git is more or less to:

-   Set up Git in your project or folder by starting it as a
    "repository".
-   Tell Git to track a file by preparing it to be saved to the history.
-   Save changes to files in the history with a message you recorded
    about the change.

Other things you can do with Git:

-   Check what's been changed or added in your files since the last
    save.
-   Check the history for what was previously changed or added.

When working with GitHub, there are extra things you can do (more on
this later):

-   Synchronize the Git repository on your computer with the repository
    on your GitHub, called "push" (upload) and "pull" (download).

So first off, *what exactly is the Git repository?* The Git repository
works at the project (the folder) level because it stores the version
history in the hidden `.git/` folder. In Windows, this folder will
probably not be hidden, but in Mac and Linux, files and folders that
start with `.` are automatically hidden. The `.git/` folder itself is
the repository used by Git to store the file changes and history of the
project. So don't delete it!

Another important file for managing the repository is the `.gitignore`
file. This file tells Git to *not* track (or "watch") certain files,
such as temporary files. This is *particularly* important for making
sure you don't save personal data in the Git history. Personal data
should be stored in a *secure location* and should *only* be accessed in
the R Project by loading it from that secure location.

```         
LearningR
├── .git/ <-- Git repository stored here
├── R/
├── data/
├── data-raw/
├── docs/
├── .gitignore <-- Tells Git which files NOT to save
├── LearningR.Rproj
├── DESCRIPTION
└── README.md
```

Setting up a Git repository can be done in several ways:

-   When starting a new R Project, the "Create a git repository" option
    can be selected from the "New Projects" setup instructions in
    RStudio.
-   For existing R Projects, you can type in the console
    `usethis::use_git()` (*don't do this for the course!*).

The `usethis::use_r()` command creates R scripts in the `R/` folder. As
you may tell, the `{usethis}` package can be quite handy. For the first
few sessions, we will be working the R scripts and then later will move
over to Quarto files instead. Why? Working with R, you will be doing a
lot of coding and writing in both types of files, so we want you to get
practice using both.

## Using Git in RStudio

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
## Instructor note

Since they will be using the Git interface quite a bit, really take your
time walking through it and describing it. Show where things are and
what things to focus on for this course.
:::

Git was initially created to be used in the terminal (i.e command-line).
However, because RStudio has a very nice interface for working with Git,
we'll be using that interface so we don't have to switch to another
application. While the terminal provides full access to Git's power and
features, the vast majority of daily use can be done through RStudio's
interface.

To access the Git interface in RStudio, click the Git icon beside the
"Go to" search bar (see @fig-rstudio-git-button) and then click the
"Commit..." option using {{< var keybind.git >}}.

![The location of the Git button in
RStudio.](../images/rstudio-git-button.png){#fig-rstudio-git-button}

The Git interface should look something like @fig-rstudio-git-interface
below. A short written description is given below the image.

![The Git interface in
RStudio.](../images/rstudio-git-interface.png){#fig-rstudio-git-interface}

1.  This is the "Changes" and "History" buttons that allow you to switch
    between views. Changes is what is currently changed in your files
    relative to the last history item. History is the record of what was
    done, to what file, when, and by whom.
2.  These are the "Push" and "Pull" buttons that are used to synchronize
    with GitHub, which we will cover later in the session.
3.  This is the panel that lists the files that have been modified in
    some way. You add ("stage") files here that you want to be put into
    the history.
4.  This is the Commit Message box where you write the message about the
    changes that will be put into the history.
5.  This is the panel that shows what text has been modified, added, or
    removed from the file selected in panel 3. Green highlight indicates
    that something has been added, while red indicates a removal.
    Changes are detected at the line level (what line in the file). For
    files that aren't plain text-based (e.g. Word), you can *not* see
    what specifically was changed, it will only say that there is a
    change.

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
## Instructor note

Do this part as a code-along, after having explained the above first.
:::

So far, it should show a bunch of files that we've added and used over
the previous session. In the Git interface, select the `README.md` file.
You should see the text in the file, all in green. Green means the text
has been added. Red, which you will see shortly, means text was removed.

Now click the "Staged" checkbox besides the `README.md` file to get it
ready to be saved into the history. You've now "added" it to the staged
area. Note that when you have a lot of files to stage, you can stage
them all at once by pressing `Ctrl-A` to highlight and select all the
files and then clicking the "Staged" checkbox (or hitting `Space`) on
one of the files. The box on the right side is where you type out your
"commit" message. "Commit" means you save something to the history of
changes. You "commit" it to the history, like you "commit" something to
your own memory.

## Reading task: \~5 minutes

Before we move on, there are some things to know about how Git works. In
Git, there are three "states" that a file can be in, listed below and
summarised in @fig-git-states.

1.  The *Working folder* state is where all files are, whether they are
    "untracked" or "tracked". Untracked is when Git sees the file, but
    it has not yet entered the history. Tracked is when the file has
    been saved in the history and Git "watches" it for changes.
2.  The *Staged* state is when a file has a change that is different
    compared to the version in the history and it has been checked
    ("added") into the "Staged" area (by ticking the checkbox beside the
    file in the Git interface).
3.  The *History* or *Committed* state is when a "commit" message has
    been written and the file with its changes has been saved into the
    repository history.

```{mermaid fig-git-states}

sequenceDiagram
    participant W as Working folder
    participant S as Staged
    participant H as History
    W->>S: Add
    S->>H: Commit
```

This system allows us to keep a journal (a *log*) of what has been
changed, why it has been changed, who changed it, and when.
@fig-rstudio-git-interface-log below shows an example log of the history
of a previous version of this lesson, which makes it easy to get an
overview of what is happening in a project.

![An example of a history for this course's
repository.](../images/rstudio-git-interface-log.png){#fig-rstudio-git-interface-log}

You may notice that the messages in the log give a bit of detail about
why a change was made, though it's not always the case. Sometimes a
message like "minor edit" is enough, because it was a minor edit.

A general tip for writing an effective commit message is to be *concise
but meaningful*. Writing down meaningful messages can save you a lot of
time in the future when you come back to a project after some time and
forget what you were doing. With a well written history you can get a
quick idea or reminder about the state of the project.
:::

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
## Instructor note

Verbally explain the above to reinforce the concepts, than do the rest
as a code-along.

For going over the Git history pane, demonstrate how you can open a file
at that commit, so that nothing is ever lost.
:::

Ok, now write something like "Add initial README file" in the commit
message box and commit the change. After clicking "Commit", you'll
notice that the `README.md` file is no longer on the left side. That's
because we've put the change into the history. We can view the history
by clicking the "History" button in the top-left corner of the RStudio
Git interface. Here you can see what has been done in previous commits.

The "History" section is quite powerful. As long as you commit something
into the Git history, it will never be completely
gone[^version-control-1]. For instance, we can see the full contents of
a file at a specific commit by clicking the commit, moving to the file
you want to look into, and clicking the link that says
`View file @ ...`. Try that with the first commit of the README file.
See how it shows what was there before you made more changes?

[^version-control-1]: This isn't completely true, you can delete stuff,
    like if you accidentally add a password or personal data.

<!-- TODO: Add an image here of opening a file at a location. -->

Next, open up the `README.md` file in RStudio using the Files tab. At
the top of the file, write your name and your field of research, and
then save the file. Open up the Git interface again (with the Git icon
or with {{< var keybind.git >}}). You should now see the added text in
green. Alright, now "Stage" the change (click the checkbox), write a
message like "added my name to README file", and commit the change. Go
back to the history and you should see the two commits in your
repository. If you don't see it in the history, you likely need to click
the refresh button at the top.

A question that may come up is "how often should I commit"? In general,
it's better to commit fairly frequently and to commit changes that are
related to each other and to the commit message. Following this basic
principle will make your history easier for you to read and make it
easier for others as well.

## Exercise: Committing to history

> Time: 15 minutes.

When working on your own projects and when you use Git, you will be
committing a *lot* of changes to your files into the Git history. Part
of the initial barrier is simply getting used to this workflow of
committing what you've changed. Use this exercise to get some practice.
We will be using this workflow often throughout the rest of the course.

1.  Practice the add-commit ("add to staging"-"committing to history")
    sequence by adding and committing *each* of the remaining files in
    your R project *one at a time* into the Git history (e.g. the
    `.gitignore`, the `.R` files, and the `.Rproj` file). While you
    could add and commit them all at once, we want you to do them one at
    a time so you practice using this workflow.
    -   Make sure to write a meaningful and short message about what you
        added and why. In this case, the "why" is simply that you are
        saving the file into the history for the first time.
2.  Once all the files have been added and committed, add a new line to
    the `R/learning.R` with an R comment (starts with a `#`). Type out
    something like "This will be used for testing out Git". Add and
    commit that new line you've written.

## Summary

-   Use the version control system Git to track changes to your files,
    to more easily manage your project, and to more easily collaborate
    with others.
-   Git tracks files in three states: "Working directory", "Staged", and
    "History".
    -   The Git repository contains the history.
-   The main actions to move between states are:
    -   "Add to staging"
    -   "Commit to history"
-   When committing to history, keep messages short and meaningful.
    Focus more on **why** the change was made, not what.
-   Almost all Git actions can be done using RStudio's Git interface.
