# Setting up an R project {#sec-setup-project}

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
## Instructor note

Because it is the first session, take it slowly. Regularly check for
learner's understanding and make use of the stickies/hats to do so.
:::

To do data analysis effectively and in an organised and less stressful
way, everything comes down to how you setup and structure your folders
and files. Essentially, how to make your analysis project into a
self-contained project at the folder level. This session will cover how
to set up a project into an RStudio R Project and structure the files
and folders using the `{prodigenr}` package.

## :book: Reading task: What is a project and why use it?

**Time: \~5 minutes**

Before we create a project, we should first define what we mean by
"project". What is a project? In a research context, a project is a set
of files that together lead to some type of scientific "output" or
"product", for instance a scientific document. Use data for your output?
That's part of the project. Do any analysis on the data to give some
results? Also part of the project. Write a document based on the data
and results? Have figures inserted into the output document? These are
also part of the project.

More and more *how* we make a claim in a scientific product is just as
important as the output describing the claim. This includes not only the
written description of the methods but also the exact steps taken, that
is, the code used. So, using a project file organization can help with
keeping things self-contained and easier to track and link with your
scientific product. Here are some things to consider when working in
projects:

-   Organise all files necessary for the scientific product in one
    folder (also called "directory") along with sub-folders so it is
    more *self-contained* (doesn't rely on other components in your
    computer).
-   Use a common and consistent folder and file structure for your
    projects.
-   Use [version
    control](https://happygitwithr.com/big-picture.html#why-git) to
    track changes to your files.
-   Make raw data "read-only" (don't edit it directly) and use code to
    show what was done.
-   Whenever possible, use code to create output (figures, tables)
    rather than manually creating or editing them.
-   Think of your code and project like you do your scientific document
    or thesis: that other people will eventually look at it and review
    it, and that it will likely also be published or archived online.

These simple steps can be huge steps toward being reproducible in your
analysis. And by managing your projects in a reproducible fashion,
you'll not only make your science better and more rigorous, it also
makes your life easier too!

## :speech_balloon: Discussion activity: How do you organise your files and projects?

**Time: \~8 minutes**

This seems so basic, how files are organized on computers. We literally
work with files all the time on computers. But consider, how do you
organize them? Take some time to discuss and share with your neighbour.

1.  Take 1 minute to think to yourself.
2.  Take 5 minutes to discuss and share with your neighbour.
3.  For the remaining time, we will all share our thoughts with the
    group.

## RStudio and R Projects

RStudio helps us with managing projects by making use of [R
Projects](https://docs.posit.co/ide/user/ide/guide/code/projects.html#working-with-projects).
RStudio R Projects make it easy to divide your work projects into a
"container", that have their own working directory (the folder where
your analysis occurs), workspace (where all the R activity and output is
temporarily saved), history, and documents.

## :teacher: Instructor note

Briefly mention to the learners about challenges that can happen when
using OneDrive, Dropbox, or other file synchronization services.
:::

::: {.callout-warning appearance="default"}
File synchronizing and backup services like OneDrive or Dropbox are very
common. Unfortunately, they also can be a major source of frustration
and difficulty when working with data analysis projects. This is because
of the way they synchronize files, by constantly looking at changes to
files and then synchronizing when a change occurs. When doing data
analysis, especially as you get more advanced and use reproducible
documents and version control systems, changes to files can happen very
often and very quickly. This can essentially cause these services to
"spasm" and may overwrite the changes that are happening. Whenever
possible, always save your work *on your computer* and **not** on these
services.
:::

There are many ways one could organise a project folder. We'll be
setting up a project folder and file structure using `{prodigenr}`.
We'll use RStudio's "New Project" menu item under:

```
File -> New Project.. -> New directory -> Scientific Analysis Project using prodigenr
```

We'll call the new project **`LearningR`**. Save it on your `Desktop/`.
See @fig-prodigenr-project-creation for the steps to do it:

![Creating a new analysis project in
RStudio.](/videos/rstudio-prodigenr-projects.gif){#fig-prodigenr-project-creation}

::: {.callout-tip appearance="default"}
You can also type the below function into the Console, but we won't do
that in this session.

```{r prodigenr-setup}
#| filename: "Console"
#| eval: false
prodigenr::setup_project("~/Desktop/LearningR")
```
:::

After we've created a New Project in RStudio, we'll have a bunch of new
files and folders.

```
LearningR
├── .git/
├── R/
│   └── README.md
├── data/
│   └── README.md
├── data-raw/
│   └── README.md
├── docs/
│   └── README.md
├── .gitignore
├── DESCRIPTION
├── LearningR.Rproj
├── README.md
└── TODO.md
```

This forces a specific and consistent folder structure to all your work.
Think of this like the "Introduction", "Methods", "Results", and
"Discussion" sections of your paper. Each project is then like a single
scientific report, that contains everything relevant to that specific
project. There is a lot of power in something as simple as a consistent
file and folder structure. Projects are used to make life easier. Once a
project is opened within RStudio the following actions are automatically
taken:

-   A new R session (process) is started.
-   The R session's working directory is set to the project directory.
-   RStudio project options are loaded.

Each R project is designated with a `.Rproj` file. This file contains
information about the file path and various metadata. So, when opening
an R project, you need to open it using the `.Rproj` file.

A project can be opened by either double clicking on the `.Rproj` from
your file browser or from the file prompt within R Studio:

```
File -> Open Project
```

or

```
File -> Recent Project.. -> LearningR
```

Within the project we created, there are several README files in each
folder that explain a bit about what should be placed there. Briefly:

1.  Documents like reports, theses, conference abstracts, and
    exploration type documents should be put in the `docs/` directory,
    including [Quarto](https://quarto.org) files. We will cover this
    later in @sec-reproducible-documents.
2.  Data, raw data, and metadata should be in either the `data/`
    directory or in `data-raw/` for the raw data. We'll explain this
    more in @sec-import-data.
3.  All `.R` files (called scripts) and code should be in the `R/`
    directory.
4.  The `.git/` directory is where Git stores all the information about
    the changes made to the project's file. This is called [version
    control](https://happygitwithr.com/big-picture.html#why-git) and
    we'll cover this in @sec-version-control.

## :book: Reading task: What's in a (file) name?

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal" collapse="true"}
## :teacher: Instructor note

Briefly go over this section with them to reinforce what they read.
:::

**Time: \~10 minutes**

Something so simple as the name of a file can have a huge impact on how
easy it is for others, including yourself in the future, as well as
computers, to navigate and work on your project. Everything we humans do
comes down to effective communication. And naming your files is one form
of communication, so be effective, clear, and explicit when doing it!

Look over some example names for files below and think about what they
communication, how effective they are at it, and what are some good and
bad things you might notice.file naming. Which file names are good names
and which aren't? We'll briefly discuss them afterwards about why some
are good names and others are not.

```
fit models.R
fit-models.R
foo.r
stuff.r
get_data.R
Thesis version 10.docx
thesis.docx
new version of analysis.R
trying.something.here.R
plotting-regression.R
utility_functions.R
code.R
```

Just like how we have standards as grammar and rules for writing natural
languages like English in order to effectively communicate to others and
ourselves, there are also standards for how and what to name files. In
general, it's better to follow a commonly used style guide like the
tidyverse [guide for file
naming](https://style.tidyverse.org/files.html). Based on their guide,
files should generally be lowercase and use either `_` or `-` instead of
a space, though using `-` tends to be more commonly used. File names
should also generally describe what the file contains. So, using these
guidelines, we'll critically review the file names from above.

### Spacing {.unnumbered}

While humans have no problem with spaces in file names, computers often
do. It becomes especially obvious that computers don't handle spaces
well as you start coding more in R or other programming languages.
Unfortunately, computers rarely warn you or encourage you to not use
spaces, so it's up to you to remember to not use them. Instead of
spaces, use `-` or `_` to separate words in a file name.

```
# Bad: Has a space.
fit models.R
Thesis version 10.docx
new version of analysis.R

# Good: No spaces.
fit-models.R
get_data.R
thesis.docx
plotting-regression.R
utility_functions.R
```

### Descriptive {.unnumbered}

Communication is about describing something in a way that someone else
understands it in the way that you are trying to convey it. The same
goes for file names. A good file name should describe what the file
contains. This is especially important when you have many files in a
project. If you can't tell what a file contains from its name, you'll
have to open it to find out. This can waste a lot of time for you in the
future and for others when they look at your project. So, make sure to
name your file to briefly describe what it contains or what it does.

```
# Bad: Not descriptive.
foo.r
stuff.r
code.R
new version of analysis.R
trying.something.here.R

# Good: Descriptive.
get_data.R
thesis.docx
plotting-regression.R
utility_functions.R
```

### Dots {.unnumbered}

Computers often use `.` dots to indicate the file extension or file
type. So, when you name files, don't use dots in the name unless the
text after the dot is the file extensions.

```
# Bad: Using dots
trying.something.here.R
```

## Summary

-   Use `{prodigenr}` to assist with setting up a new project, with
    standard files and folders to begin working on a data analysis
    project.
-   Use R Projects in RStudio to manage your project and make it easier
    to work with R in it.
-   How you name your files is the first step to communicating the
    files' contents with yourself in the future and with others. Use the
    tidyverse style guide for file naming.
