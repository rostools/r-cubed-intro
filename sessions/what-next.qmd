It is one thing to learn the principles of how to do reproducible
research. It is quite another thing to do so in daily practice. So, how
can you practice these skills and tools you learned during the course?

-   If you have your own data already, then it's easy: Start using these
    tools bit by bit, step by step. It doesn't have to be all at once.
    Slowly and steadily use the tools and skills from this course and
    continue learning. It isn't a race, use what you can without getting
    totally overwhelmed.
-   Check out the [Learning](https://guides.rostools.org/learning.html)
    page of the Guides website for resources on continued learning.
-   If your collaborators or supervisor don't use these tools from the
    course, are not supportive, or are supportive but not able to learn
    and use these tools themselves, e.g. they are too busy, there are
    several steps you can take. This situation is definitely challenging
    and is likely to be most commonly encountered. Use the tools as best
    you can, small bits at a time, so that you continue learning but
    don't get completely overwhelmed with all the new things and ways to
    do things. Below are some potential small steps to take that you can
    choose from to start incorporating and using R and reproducibility
    in your work:
    -   As much as possible, setup your projects, folders, and files in
        a more reproducible way (e.g. through using the structure
        created from the `{prodigenr}` package).
    -   Create all your figures entirely in R and using R scripts or
        Quarto documents.
    -   Write everything research related in Quarto and convert to a
        Word document when you need to send to co-authors. If they make
        edits or comments, include the edits in the original Quarto
        file, and *do not* keep them in the Word document.
    -   Start slowly making use of Git, even if you can't or are not
        comfortable yet with sharing on GitHub. Git and GitHub are two
        separate things and Git can still be used on your computer
        without putting it up online.
    -   Use R entirely to wrangle and clean your data rather than, e.g.
        opening up Excel and editing the data there.
-   If you're restricted to working with your data in a virtual remote
    environment (e.g. in Denmark Statistics), you may not have
    authorization to install some programs. However, most remote
    environments have the latest software used for data analysis type
    tasks.

## How do you share?

How do you share? We recommend a combination of GitHub and
[Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/) to share your code. And we're already
showing you how to use GitHub, so you're one step closer to sharing on
your own!

Next question might, when do you share? Right away! No matter how ugly
the code is. If its ugly, that's fine! The point is you start and that
you get more comfortable doing it until it becomes second nature to
share and in the process, your code gets better because you know someone
might look at your code.

And even if your code isn't reproducible, even if others can't run it
own their own, sharing is the first step to becoming better. At the
least, others can inspect your code for its overall logic.

We as researchers try to find our niche, make our own space in the
research world. Sometimes its a real struggle to find that niche... but
this is one of those niches! Very few people are sharing their code! You
start doing the simplest thing of sharing your code and you will be one
of very very few people who do. And this isn't a niche, this is a gaping
hole in our modern scientific process.

So as soon as you have an analysis project set up, put it up on either
GitHub or GitLab (another service like GitHub). Alternatively, you can
upload it when you also finish your manuscript.

## What else can you do?

The other things you can start doing is find or start building a
community of people who also use R or are doing reproducibility or any
other computational work. Use them as support and help and also give
back too.

Start doing code reviews in your research group. Code review would be
where you look over each others code, check that it works, check that it
makes sense, that it's readable and understandable. The nice thing with
doing code reviews is that it dispels the mystery around code and about
criticizing it and trying to improve it. We review manuscripts, why not
code? Do note though, that this is way easier said than done!

You can teach! Teach others. Use these teaching materials. Or get
involved with this course next year. Or now! Several participants from
these courses are or will soon be helping to improve the material for
next year. There are also so many other things you can get involved in,
aside from this course. Let us know if you're interested!

:star: Do you find this course material useful? Then please consider
"starring" our [GitHub
repository](https://github.com/rostools/r-cubed-intro/) to show your
support! Starring will save it to a list of repositories you like that
you can easily find again, plus it helps give our project more
visibility!
