# Collaborating with GitHub {#sec-github}

<!-- TODO: Add an introduction here -->

GitHub is a popular online service for hosting Git repositories. It
also makes collaborating on projects much easier. In this session, we
will cover what GitHub is and how to use it with your R project that
is a Git repository.

Briefly go over this next section, especially highlighting the image.

A version control system that didn't include a type of external backup
wouldn't be a very good system, because if something happened to your
computer, you'd lose your Git repository. In Git, this "external" backup
is called a "remote", meaning it is something that is separate and in a
different location, usually online, than the main repository. The remote
repository is essentially a duplicate copy of the *history*, found in
the `.git/` folder, of your *local* repository on your computer. So when
you synchronize with the remote, as illustrated in @fig-git-remotes, it
only copies over the changes made as commits in the history.

One of the biggest reasons why we teach Git is because of the popularity
of several Git repository hosting sites. The most popular one is
[GitHub](https://github.com/) (which this workshop is hosted on). In
this session, we'll be covering GitHub not only because it is very
popular, but also because the R community is almost entirely on GitHub.

Let's get familiar with the GitHub interface.

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
## Instructor note

Go over the interface of GitHub, especially where repositories are
listed, the sidebar of the landing page (of your account), and where
your account settings are.

Also, reinforce the warning and note below.
:::

::: {.callout-warning appearance="default"}
When using GitHub, especially in relation to health research, you need
to be mindful of what you save into the Git history and what you put up
online. Some things to think about are:

-   **Do not** save any personal or sensitive data or files in your Git
    repository.
-   Generally don't save very large files, like big image files or large
    (non-personal) datasets.

In both cases, it's better to use another tool to store files like that,
rather than through Git and GitHub.
:::

::: callout-note
Some research projects require working on restricted server environments
(such as [Denmark Statistics](https://www.dst.dk/en) when doing research
on the Danish register data), where access to the internet is not
available. This means that you can't use GitHub or any other online Git
repository hosting service. However, you can still use Git on those
servers without using a remote.
:::

## :book: Reading task: Using GitHub as a remote

**Time: \~3 minutes**

Making and cloning a GitHub repository is the first step to linking a
local repository to a remote one. We are creating a GitHub repository
from an existing local one, but you can also create one on GitHub first.
More details about manually creating repositories on GitHub is found in
@sec-extra-github.

After connecting your local Git repository, to keep your GitHub
repository synchronized, you need to "push" (upload) and "pull"
(download) any changes you make to the repository on your computer, as
shown in @fig-git-remotes-synch. It isn't done automatically because Git
is designed with having control in mind, so you must do this
synchronization manually. "Pushing" is when changes to the history are
uploaded to GitHub while "pulling" is when the history is downloaded
from GitHub.

```{mermaid}
%%| label: fig-git-remotes-synch
%%| fig-cap: "Synchronizing with GitHub: 'Pushing' and 'pulling'."
%%| echo: false
%%| eval: true
graph TB
    linkStyle default interpolate basis
    A('Remote':<br>GitHub) -- Pull --> B('Local':<br>Your computer)
    B -- Push --> A

    style A fill:White,stroke:DarkBlue,stroke-width:1.5px;
    style B fill:White,stroke:DarkBlue,stroke-width:1.5px;
```

So, when we put the concepts back into the framework of the "states",
first introduced in @sec-basics-of-git, pushing and pulling *happen only
to the history*. Things that you've changed *and then* saved to the
history, either on the remote or the local repository, are synchronized
from or to GitHub. So, as shown in @fig-git-states-with-github, pushing
copies of the history over to GitHub and pulling copies of the history
from GitHub. Since changes saved in the history also reflect the working
folder (the files and folders you actually see and interact with),
"pulling" also updates the files and folders.

```{mermaid}
%%| label: fig-git-states-with-github
%%| fig-cap: Which states get 'pushed' and 'pulled'.

%%| eval: true

```

Interacting with GitHub through R requires us to use something called a
"personal access token", which you will learn about and create in the
next exercise.

## :book: Reading task: Authenticating with GitHub

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
## :teacher: Teacher note

Very briefly reinforce the importance of using a PAT rather than your
own password. Also emphasize the use of a password manager.
:::

**Time: \~3 minutes.**

Any time we do anything on the internet, there is some risk to having
our information maliciously hacked. This is no different when using
GitHub, so if you can, you should try to be more secure with what you
send across the internet. In fact, most functions that relate to Git or
using GitHub *require* using more secure features in order to work.
`{usethis}` makes this much easier, thankfully, with several functions.
The `{usethis}` website has a really [well written
guide](https://usethis.r-lib.org/articles/articles/git-credentials.html)
on setting it up. Here is a very simplified version of what they
recommend that is relevant for what we are doing in this workshop.

-   Use personal access tokens (PAT, or simply called a "token") when
    interacting with your GitHub remote repositories while outside of
    the GitHub website (e.g. when using R or `{usethis}`). PAT's are
    like temporary passwords that provide limited access to your GitHub
    account, like being able to upload to or download from your GitHub
    repositories, but not being able to delete them. They are useful
    because you can easily delete the PAT if you think someone got
    access to it so that you can stop the PAT from being used for
    harmful purposes.

-   Use a password manager to save the PAT for later use. Using password
    managers is basically a requirement for having secure online
    accounts, because they can generate random and long passwords that
    you don't have to remember. This is why we recommended you install
    one during the pre-workshop tasks.

-   Use packages like `{gitcreds}` to give `{usethis}` access to the PAT
    and to interact with your GitHub repositories. You normally would
    use `{gitcreds}` every time you restart your computer or after a
    certain period of time.

::: callout-tip
As a reminder, a password manager is an app or web service that let's
you save or create passwords for all your accounts, like banking or
social media. Instead of having to remember multiple passwords used
across multiple accounts, or the very insecure approach of one or two
passwords for all your accounts, you instead need to remember only one
very secure password that contains all your other very secure passwords.
You can google "password manager" and your operating system (Windows,
MacOS) to search for possible ones to install or use. We recommend using
[Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/).

## Authenticating with GitHub

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
## :teacher: Teacher note

Go through this with them slowly, explaining things along the way.
Especially emphasize the importance of saving the PAT in a password
manager, at the least to **not** save it in a file in the project
itself.
:::

Since we use R, there is a really useful set of functions from
`{usethis}` to make it easy interact with and setup connections to
GitHub from RStudio. So, let's connect our projects to GitHub! Before we
can link the projects' Git repository to GitHub, we need to inform
GitHub that we are the owner of the account by authenticating ourselves.

Very likely no one has set up a PAT yet with GitHub, but we'll run a
check just to see by running this function in the Console.

``` {.r filename="Console"}
usethis::gh_token_help()
```

Which should output something like this:

```
• GitHub host: 'https://github.com'
• Personal access token for 'https://github.com': <unset>
• To create a personal access token, call `create_github_token()`
• To store a token for current and future use, call `gitcreds::gitcreds_set()`
ℹ Read more in the 'Managing Git(Hub) Credentials' article:
  https://usethis.r-lib.org/articles/articles/git-credentials.html
```

The output is saying the token is `<unset>`, which means we need to set
it up on our computer. We do that by typing the next function in the
Console to create the token on GitHub (if one isn't set already).

``` {.r filename="Console"}
usethis::create_github_token()
```

This function sends us to the GitHub "Generate new token" webpage with
all the necessary settings checked. Set the "Expiry date" to 90 days
(this is a good security feature). Then, scroll down to the bottom
without changing anything else and click the green button at the bottom
called "Generate token". Afterwards there will be a very long string
that's been generated that starts with `ghp_`. **Save this token in your
password manager**. Alternatively, leave this page open to copy and
paste the token whenever it's needed. If this token gets lost, no
worries! It's very easy create a new one by re-running the
`usethis::create_github_token()` function.

::: callout-important
Do *not* save the token in the project we're working in for the
workshop! Save it somewhere else.
:::

This token we created is what we'll use every time we open up RStudio
and interact with GitHub through R. A token does **not** need to be
created for each of our R projects. A new token is only needed when the
current token expires (typically every couple of months) or if we've
lost the token.

In the Console, run:

``` {.r filename="Console"}
gitcreds::gitcreds_set()
```

And then copy and paste your token into the prompt in the Console. This
token usually gets saved for the day (it gets cached), but after
restarting you may likely need to run the action again. If it asks to
replace an existing one, select the "yes" option. Doing this is a bit
like using the two-factor authentication (2FA) you have to do when you,
for instance, want to access your online bank account or other
government website. In this case, you are telling GitHub (when
interacting with it through RStudio, like uploading and downloading your
changes) that you are who you claim to digitally be.

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
## :teacher: Teacher note

Mention this helpful function below, but you don't need to run it.
:::

::: callout-tip
There is another great helper function that runs a lot of checks and
gives some advice when it finds potential problems.

``` r
usethis::git_sitrep()
```

Just to be aware, using this function outputs a *lot* of stuff, most of
which you probably don't even need to know or don't even know what it
means. That's ok, since it is meant as a diagnostic tool.
:::

## Linking your project to GitHub

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
## :teacher: Teacher note

As with above, go through this section slowly, explaining things as you
go along. Briefly expand on and reinforce what the word "origin" means
when it comes up.

Visually show the diagrams and explain it.
:::

Now that we have authenticated ourselves to GitHub, we can connect our
project's Git repository to GitHub. If you are new to Git and GitHub, we
strongly recommend starting your first work project(s) as private, in
case you accidentally add files you aren't supposed to. It will also
help get you get more comfortable with using Git and GitHub. However,
for this workshop, we will be keeping it public. To make it private, we
would add the argument `private = TRUE` to the function below. For now,
go to the Console and run this function to make a public repository:

``` {.r filename="Console"}
usethis::use_github()
```

::: callout-note
You may have to manually enter your username and password, even though
you used `gitcreds::gitcreds_set()`.

If you have troubles logging in, you may need to update Git.
:::

::: callout-tip
You might notice the word `origin` when referring to remotes. The word
*origin* is the default short name to refer to the location of the
remote (the GitHub URL). You will probably see this word in many other
places to refer to a remote.
:::

The `use_github()` function will take your project and upload it to
GitHub. Now, whenever you use Git and save your changes to the Git
history, whenever you "Push" your changes it will be sent to your
project on GitHub. The diagram below shows how it conceptually looks
like:

```{mermaid fig-local-vs-remote}
%%| label: fig-local-vs-remote
%%| fig-cap: Schematic showing a local repository connected to GitHub's remote repository.
%%| echo: false
%%| eval: true
%%{init:{'theme':'forest', 'flowchart':{'nodeSpacing': 20, 'rankSpacing':30}}}%%
graph LR;
    yours(Your local) -->|Push| github(GitHub)
    github -->|Pull| yours
```

The "Your local" is your own computer. Whenever you "push" to GitHub, it
means it will upload your file changes (like synchronizing in Dropbox).
Whenever you "pull" from GitHub, it takes any changes made on GitHub and
downloads them to your "Local" computer.

Using GitHub (because of Git) is one of the most effective ways to
collaborate on a project. Hundreds of companies and hundreds of
thousands of workers use Git and services like GitHub to work together
on massive projects. The way collaboration works would conceptually look
like:

```{mermaid fig-local-collab-and-remote}
%%| label: fig-local-collab-and-remote
%%| fig-cap: Schematic showing a local repository, GitHub's remote repository, and a collaborator's repository.
%%| echo: false
%%| eval: true
%%{init:{'theme':'forest', 'flowchart':{'nodeSpacing': 20, 'rankSpacing':30}}}%%
graph LR;
    yours(Your local) -->|Push| github(GitHub)
    github -->|Pull| yours
    others(Collaborator's<br>local) -->|Push| github
    github -->|Pull| others
```

This approach to collaborating makes it much easier to contribute
*directly* (not through emails) to projects and to more easily help
others out with issues.

## Synchronizing with GitHub

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal" collapse="true"}
## :teacher: Instructor note

Go through this section slowly, remembering to make use of the
stickies/origami hats to check that everyone is following along.
:::

After we've created the token and put our project onto GitHub, we can
now push and pull any changes you make to the files. Let's practice how
it works.

Open up the `docs/learning.qmd` and write a random sentence somewhere
near the top of the file (below the YAML header). Then save the file.
Open the Git interface with {{< var keybind.git >}}, "stage" the file,
and write a commit message. Click the "Commit" button.

Now time to test out pushing the change to GitHub. Click the "Push"
button in the top right corner of the Git interface. A pop-up will
indicate that it's pushing and will show some text after it's pushed. Go
to our GitHub repository to see that it worked!

Now let's try the opposite way, by making a change on GitHub, committing
the changes there, and then pulling changes from GitHub to your local
repository (on your computer).

While in your `LearningR` GitHub repository, click into the `docs/`
folder and then click the `learning.qmd` file there. Then click the
"Edit" button (the pencil icon) in the top right corner of the file
view. You'll be taken to a web-based editor.

Write another random sentence somewhere near the top of the file (below
the YAML header). Scroll down to the commit message box, and type out a
commit message. Then, click the "Commit" button. We've now made a change
on the repository in GitHub. Let's synchronize it to our local
repository.

Go back to RStudio, open the Git interface and now click the "Pull"
button in the top right corner beside the "Push" button. Wait for it to
finish pulling and check your `docs/learning.qmd` file for the new
change. You've now updated your project!

After they've read the text, briefly go over the image and emphasize why
collaborating this way makes things easier. If you have some personal
experiences, please share them!
:::

**Time: \~10 minutes**

While Git and GitHub are useful on even when you work alone, it's main
and biggest advantage is that it makes it much easier to collaborate
with others on a project.

Academia is unfortunately far behind when it comes to using modern tools
to effectively collaborate together. Most researchers still use emails
to send Word or other files back and forth, and while this is a very
simple and non-technical way to collaborate as it requires very little
learning or training to use, it is *not* very effective.

Usually this style of collaborating revolves around one or two people
doing most of the actual writing or direct contributing, while others
give feedback or indirectly contribute through discussions or meetings.
You might be familiar with using "Track changes" in Word when doing this
style of collaborating. If your collaborators are a bit more technical,
you all might be using Google Docs to do real-time collaboration
together.

When you use Git and GitHub and write in Quarto documents, this style of
collaborating isn't possible. For one, there is no "track changes"
feature in Quarto documents. Instead, you need to use another way of
collaborating, one that is much more effective and extremely powerful.
This workflow of using Git and GitHub has been tried and tested by tens
of thousands of teams in tens of hundreds of companies globally. One of
the goals of this workshop is to slowly move researchers more into the
modern era, using more modern technology, tools, and workflows so that
we can produce better research faster.

How does the workflow look like when using Git and GitHub? It works by
using the concept of remotes that we introduced earlier. Since a local
repository is a copy of a remote repository, anyone else can collaborate
on your project by copying the remote repository. When they want to
contribute back, they make commits to their local copy and push those
changes up to the remote. Then you can pull those changes to your local
repository and do the same thing by committing and then pushing. This is
illustrated in @fig-git-remotes-collaborate.

```{mermaid}
%%| label: fig-git-remotes-collaborate

    style B fill:White,stroke:DarkBlue,stroke-width:1.5px;
    style C fill:White,stroke:DarkBlue,stroke-width:1.5px;
```

A disadvantage to this workflow is, in order to use it to effectively,
it takes time to learn and get used to. For instance, you may think that
you can just collaborate with others by making changes directly to the
same file at the same time. But a problem comes up when you both push
and pull changes to the same file. You will encounter something called a
"merge conflict", which you'll have to learn how to resolve. Git knows
that changes were made to the same file, but it doesn't know which
change to keep and which to discard. You have to manually resolve the
conflict by opening the file and deciding which change to keep.

So, how do you manage this when collaborating with others? Always
dealing with merge conflicts sounds time-consuming and frustrating,
doesn't it? Well, that's because Git wasn't designed for that style of
collaborating. Instead, Git uses a concept called
["branches"](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-branches)
to more effectively manage multiple collaborators working on the same
project. However, branches are a bit more of an advanced topic that we
won't be covering in this workshop. Instead, when collaborating with
others, we recommend that each collaborator create their own separate
file to work on. For instance, if you are collaborating on writing a
report together, each collaborator would create their own Quarto
document to write in. When everyone is finished writing, one person can
then merge all the documents together into one final report. This way,
you avoid merge conflicts entirely. This is the approach we will get you
to use for the group project at the end of this workshop.

::: callout-tip
For public GitHub repositories, anyone can copy your repository and
contribute back (only if you want their contribution), so working with
collaborators is easy. When you have a private repository, you need to
explicitly add collaborators in GitHub.

You add someone to a private (or public) repository by going to
"Settings \> Manage Access \> Invite a collaborator". We won't do this
for the workshop, but we're telling you how you can just in case you
want to after the workshop.
:::

::: callout-tip
As we mentioned, when working with others (or even yourself) through
GitHub, you will eventually encounter "merge conflicts". This happens
when a change has been made to the same line in the same file, but in
different commits, either by you or someone else. This usually happens
if you make a change on GitHub as the remote while also making a change
on your local repository without pulling first.

When this happens, Git will not know which change to keep and will ask
you to resolve the conflict. You resolve the conflict by opening the
file in RStudio, finding the conflict, and deciding which change to keep
and which to remove. After you've resolved the conflict, you would then
stage the file and commit it.

We won't go into merge conflicts in this workshop, though you might deal
with them during the group project. If you want to learn more about them
after the workshop, GitHub has a [practical
tutorial](https://github.com/skills/resolve-merge-conflicts) on it. We
also have an extra appendix section to deal with merge conflicts in
@sec-merge-conflicts.
:::

::: callout-note
A big challenge you'll encounter with becoming better with this way of
collaborating is that most of your collaborators will likely not be
familiar with it, at least until they take this workshop. :wink:

Sadly, even experienced researchers struggle with this workflow (mainly
due to not being familiar with Git) and there is no easy answer on how
to handle this. The best way (in our opinion) is to start training any
colleague who is interested in collaborating this way and slowly
surround yourself with collaborators who also work this way.

## Summary

-   "Remotes" are external storage locations for your Git repository.
    GitHub is a popular remote repository hosting service.
    -   Downloading a Git repository from GitHub is called "cloning".
-   "Pushing" and "pulling" are actions to upload and download to the
    remote repository (which usually is called "origin"), so that you
    can synchronize your changes.
-   Collaborating together using Git and GitHub is a powerful way of
    working, but does take some learning. Collaborating involves each
    collaborator creating a copy of the remote repository that you each
    push and pull to as you work together.
