# Collaborating with GitHub {#sec-github}

<!-- TODO: Add an introduction here -->

## Learning objectives

This session's **overall learning outcome** is to:

1.  Explain how to collaborate with others (or your future self) through
    Git and GitHub, while also using it as a form of a backup.

**Specific objectives** are to:

1.  Describe the difference between a "remote" and a "local" repository.
2.  Use GitHub to store your Git repository by connecting your R project
    to GitHub.
3.  Use "pushing" and "pulling" to synchronize any changes you make
    between the local and remote repositories.
4.  Use GitHub to collaborate with others on a project.

A version control system that didn't include a type of external backup
wouldn't be a very good system, because if something happened to your
computer, you'd lose your Git repository. In Git, this "external" backup
is called a "remote", meaning it is something that is separate and in a
different location, usually online, than the main repository. The remote
repository is essentially a duplicate copy of the *history*, found in
the `.git/` folder, of your *local* repository on your computer. So when
you synchronize with the remote, as illustrated in @fig-git-remotes, it
only copies over the changes made as commits in the history.

One of the biggest reasons why we teach Git is because of the popularity
of several Git repository hosting sites. The most popular one is
[GitHub](https://github.com/) (which this course is hosted on). In this
session, we'll be covering GitHub not only because it is very popular,
but also because the R community is almost entirely on GitHub.

Let's get familiar with the GitHub interface.

## Instructor note

Go over the interface of GitHub, especially where repositories are
listed, the sidebar of the landing page (of your account), and where
your account settings are.

Also, reinforce the warning below.

::: {.callout-warning appearance="default"}
When using GitHub, especially in relation to health research, you need
to be mindful of what you save into the Git history and what you put up
online. Some things to think about are:

-   **Do not** save any personal or sensitive data or files in your Git
    repository.
-   Generally don't save very large files, like big image files or large
    (non-personal) datasets.

In both cases, it's better to use another tool to store files like that,
rather than through Git and GitHub.

## :book: Reading task: Using GitHub as a remote

**Time: \~3 minutes**

Making and cloning a GitHub repository is the first step to linking a
local repository to a remote one. We are creating a GitHub repository
from an existing local one, but you can also create one on GitHub first.
More details about manually creating repositories on GitHub is found in
@sec-extra-github.

After connecting your local Git repository, to keep your GitHub
repository synchronized, you need to "push" (upload) and "pull"
(download) any changes you make to the repository on your computer, as
shown in @fig-git-remotes-synch. It isn't done automatically because Git
is designed with having control in mind, so you must do this
synchronization manually. "Pushing" is when changes to the history are
uploaded to GitHub while "pulling" is when the history is downloaded
from GitHub.

```{mermaid fig-git-remotes-synch}
%%| label: fig-git-remotes-synch
%%| fig-cap: "Synchronizing with GitHub: 'Pushing' and 'pulling'."
%%| echo: false
%%| eval: true
graph TB
    linkStyle default interpolate basis
    A('Remote':<br>GitHub) -- Pull --> B('Local':<br>Your computer)
    B -- Push --> A

    style A fill:White,stroke:DarkBlue,stroke-width:1.5px;
    style B fill:White,stroke:DarkBlue,stroke-width:1.5px;
```

So, when we put the concepts back into the framework of the "states",
first introduced in @sec-basics-of-git, pushing and pulling *happen only
to the history*. Things that you've changed and then saved to the
history, either on the remote or the local repository, are synchronized
from or to GitHub. So, as shown in @fig-git-states-with-github, pushing
copies of the history over to GitHub and pulling copies of the history
from GitHub. Since changes saved in the history also reflect the working
folder (the files and folders you actually see and interact with),
"pulling" also updates the files and folders.

```{mermaid fig-git-states-with-github}
%%| label: fig-git-states-with-github
%%| fig-cap: Which states get 'pushed' and 'pulled'.
%%| echo: false
%%| eval: true
%%{init:{'themeCSS': ".actor {stroke: DarkBlue;fill: White;stroke-width:1.5px;}", 'sequence':{'mirrorActors': false}}}%%

    W->>S: Add
    S->>H: Commit
    H->>R: Push
    R->>H: Pull
    R->>W: Pull
```

Interacting with GitHub through R requires us to use something called a
"personal access token", which you will learn about and create in the
next exercise.

{{< text_snippet sticky_up >}}

## :technologist: Exercise: Linking your project to GitHub

**Time: \~20 minutes.**

Since we use R, there is a really useful set of functions from
`{usethis}` to make it easy interact with and setup connections to
GitHub from RStudio. Complete all of the [Connect to
GitHub](https://guides.rostools.org/connect-github.html) guide for this
exercise. In the end, you should have your `LearningR` project on
GitHub.

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
## Instructor note

On your own, run the commands in the guides. After they complete the
tasks, make sure that they have the "Push" and "Pull" buttons as well as
having the `LearningR` on GitHub.

## Synchronizing with GitHub

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal" collapse="true"}
## :teacher: Instructor note

Go through this section slowly, remembering to make use of the
stickies/origami hats to check that everyone is following along.
:::

After we've created the token and put our project onto GitHub, we can
now push and pull any changes you make to the files. Let's practice how
it works.

Open up the `README.md` and write a random sentence somewhere near the
top of the file. Then save the file. Open the Git interface with
{{< var keybind.git >}}, "stage" the file, and write a commit message.
Click the "Commit" button.

Now time to test out pushing the change to GitHub. Click the "Push"
button in the top right corner of the Git interface. A pop-up will
indicate that it's pushing and will show some text after it's pushed. Go
to our GitHub repository to see that it worked!

Now let's try the opposite way, by committing and pulling changes from
GitHub to your local repository.

While in your `LearningR` GitHub repository, click the `README.md` file
on the GitHub website, and then click the "Edit" button (see the video
below, which shows it for a random repository called `learning-github`).

Write Add another random sentence somewhere near the top of the file.
Scroll down to the commit message box, and type out a commit message.
Then, click the "Commit" button. We've made a change on the repository
in GitHub. Let's synchronize it to our local repository.

Go back to RStudio, open the Git interface and now click the "Pull"
button in the top right corner beside the "Push" button. Wait for it to
finish pulling and check your `README.md` file for the new change.
You've now updated your project!

## :book: Reading task: Collaborating using Git and GitHub

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal" collapse="true"}
## Instructor note

After they've read the text, briefly go over the image and emphasize why
collaborating this way makes things easier. If you have some personal
experiences, please share them!

**Time: \~10 minutes**

While all of the previous Git tools we covered are extremely useful when
working alone, we've been building up to using Git for it's main and
biggest advantage: to easily collaborate with others on a project.

Academia is unfortunately far behind when it comes to using modern tools
to effectively collaborate together. Most researchers still use emails
to send files back and forth, and while this is a very simple and easy
way to start doing with no learning or training required, it is *not*
very effective.

Usually this style of collaborating revolves around one or two people
doing the most of the actual writing or direct contributing, while
others give feedback or indirectly contribute through discussions or
meetings. You might be familiar with using "Track changes" in Word when
doing this style of collaborating. If your collaborators are a bit more
technical, you all might be using Google Docs to do real-time
collaboration together.

When using Git and GitHub, as well as Quarto documents, this style of
collaborating isn't possible. For one, there is no "track changes"
feature. Instead, you'd need to learn another way of collaborating
together, a way that is much more effective and extremely powerful. This
workflow of using Git and GitHub has been tried and tested by tens of
thousands of teams in tens of hundreds of companies globally. One of the
goals of this course is to slowly move researchers more into the modern
era, using more modern technology, tools, and workflows so that we can
produce better research faster.

How does the workflow look like when using Git and GitHub? It works on
the concept of remotes that we introduced earlier. Since a local
repository is a copy of a remote repository, anyone else can collaborate
on your project by copying the remote repository. When they want to
contribute back, they make commits to their local copy and push those
changes up to the remote. Then you can pull to your local copy and do
the same thing. This is illustrated in @fig-git-remotes-collaborate.

```{mermaid fig-git-remotes-collaborate}
%%| label: fig-git-remotes-collaborate
%%| fig-cap: Collaborating with others using Git and GitHub by having a shared central GitHub repository.
%%| echo: false
%%| eval: true
graph TB
    linkStyle default interpolate basis
    A('Remote':<br>GitHub) -- Pull --> B('Local':<br>Your computer)
    B -- Push --> A
    A -- Pull --> C('Local':<br>Collaborator's<br>computer)
    C -- Push --> A

    style A fill:White,stroke:DarkBlue,stroke-width:1.5px;
    style B fill:White,stroke:DarkBlue,stroke-width:1.5px;
    style C fill:White,stroke:DarkBlue,stroke-width:1.5px;
```

A disadvantage to this workflow is, in order to use it to effectively,
it takes time to learn and get used to. For instance, while it is
entirely possible to make changes to the same file as other
collaborators if you use Git the way it was designed for, you may not be
using it as intended since you are still learning. So when one of you
pushes the changes to the file and the other pulls those changes, you
end up with a merge conflict that you have to learn how to resolve. A
work-around is to create separate files for each collaborator and merge
them together when you are finished with the project. This is what you
will do for the group project at the end of this course.

::: callout-tip
For public GitHub repositories, anyone can copy your repository and
contribute back (only if you want their contribution), so working with
collaborators is easy. When you have a private repository, you need to
explicitly add collaborators in GitHub.

You add someone to a private (or public) repository by going to
`Settings -> Manage Access -> Invite a collaborator` (also shown in the
video below). We won't do this for the course, but we're telling you how
you can just in case you want to after the course.

{{< video /videos/github-add-collaborator.mp4 >}}
:::

::: callout-tip
As we mentioned, when working with others (or even yourself) through
GitHub, you will eventually encounter "merge conflicts". This happens
when a change has been made to the same line in the same file, but in
different commits, either by you or someone else. This usually happens
if you make a change on GitHub as the remote while also making a change
on your local repository without pulling first.

When this happens, Git will not know which change to keep and will ask
you to resolve the conflict. You resolve the conflict by opening the
file in RStudio, finding the conflict, and deciding which change to keep
and which to remove. After you've resolved the conflict, you would then
stage the file and commit it.

We won't go into merge conflicts in this course, though you might deal
with them during the group project. If you want to learn more about them
after the course, GitHub has a [practical
tutorial](https://github.com/skills/resolve-merge-conflicts) on it.
:::

::: callout-note
A big challenge you'll encounter with becoming better with this way of
collaborating is that most of your collaborators will likely not be
familiar with it, at least until they take this course. :wink:

Sadly, even experienced researchers struggle with this workflow (mainly
due to their unfamiliarity with Git) and there is no easy answer on how
to handle this. The best way (in our opinion) is to start training any
colleague who is interested in collaborating this way and slowly
surround yourself with collaborators who also work this way.

## Summary

-   "Remotes" are external storage locations for your Git repository.
    GitHub is a popular remote repository hosting service.
    -   Downloading a Git repository from GitHub is called "cloning".
-   "Pushing" and "pulling" are actions to upload and download to the
    remote repository (which usually is called "origin"), so that you
    can synchronize your changes.
-   Collaborating together using Git and GitHub is a powerful way of
    working, but does take some learning. Collaborating involves each
    collaborator creating a copy of the remote repository that you each
    push and pull to as you work together.
