## The Big Picture

To repeat from the syllabus, our **main tangible goal** is to:

-   Create a project that has a report (in HTML or Word) where you
    reproducibly import some data, process it a bit, and create some
    figures and tables, all done in a way that makes it easier for you
    and others to collaborate together.
