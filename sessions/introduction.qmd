## :book: Reading task: The Big Picture

**Time: \~10 minutes**

While you've read the syllabus, listened to the presentation, and likely
have an overall idea of why we are teaching this workshop, repetition is a
critical component to learning, so here is more emphasis on some common
considerations or thoughts you might have about the workshop.

### Why learn this now? {.unnumbered}

We are in a special time in research. We are facing several large scale
technological and societal changes:

-   We researchers are experiencing higher demands from funding
    agencies, universities, and peers for transparency and rigor in our
    research.
-   Our work is getting more and more complex, which requires higher
    degrees of (potentially highly distributed and virtual) team-based
    science.
-   There is a higher public attention on research, with mass
    participation and attention through the Internet and social media.
-   Our access to powerful computing resources and massive datasets is
    leading to an increasing rise in more complex analytics and data
    processing, such as through machine learning and AI.
-   Increasingly your research output is someone else's research input,
    such as with meta-research[^1] or meta-analysis.

[^1]: Evidence-based evaluation and development of research methods.

### What will we do? {.unnumbered}

In this workshop, our **ultimate goal** is to:

-   Create a project that has a report (in HTML or Word) where you
    reproducibly import some data, process it a bit, and create some
    figures and tables, all done in a way that makes it easier for you
    and others to collaborate together.

In the end, we're aiming for:

-   Having a self-contained project (within a single folder).
-   Having a record of changes made to the files.
-   Making it easier for others to collaborate.
-   Making it simpler to connect the project with a scientific output
    like a paper.
-   Structuring analyses to be more reproducible (or at least more
    easily *inspectable*).

### Why R? {.unnumbered}

Why are we using R and why learn it? There are many many reasons, some
of which are listed below:

-   It is open source and free. Which means that you can take the
    knowledge and skills you gain for using R anywhere you go in your
    career.
-   There is a very large, fairly friendly online community.
    -   So many learning resources, support, and help!
-   There is a **massive** selection of packages. Need to do something?
    There's probably already a package to do it for you.
    -   Latest statistical methods.
    -   Productivity tools.
    -   Report writing.
    -   Visualization.
    -   Many many more.
-   Strong push by major R developers, for instance from
    [Posit](https://posit.co) who makes RStudio and contributes heavily
    to R packages, to improve beginner-friendliness and usability of R,
    for example with the `{tidyverse}` and [Quarto](https://quarto.org).
-   R has one of the best data visualization tools available with
    `{ggplot2}`.
-   So many more powerful capabilities when it comes to:
    -   Big Data
    -   Programming
    -   Reproducibility

### Why Git and Quarto? {.unnumbered}

You probably came to this workshop to learn R. So why are we also going to
go over Git and Quarto. Well, the main learning outcome for the workshop
is **reproducible research**. And that involves more than just R.

Why do we take time to teach setting up a project folder and file
structure? Because that's the very first step in making your work
reproducible and also more organized.

Why do we teach Git? Because without sharing code, your research
*cannot* be *independently* reproducible. Using Git is the most common
way to share code.

Why do we teach Quarto? Because simply writing R code will not be enough
to ensure it is also reproducible. Quarto is a tool *designed* to run in
a reproducible way. So it forces you to write code in a way that is
reproducible.

### Why are we going slow/fast? {.unnumbered}

We always get feedback that for some it is too fast and for others it is
too slow, especially during this introductory workshop. Ideally, everyone
would say it was the perfect speed. But that is impossible to achieve.
So instead, we aim as much as possible to have fewer people say it was
too fast than people who say it was too slow. This is an introduction
workshop, so we're trying to assume as little to no knowledge on many of
these concepts. So, for those with some knowledge, it *will* feel slow
at times! You can always help your neighbour out to help pass the time
:grin: :tada:

## :teacher: Instructor note

Go through this as a code-along with the learners all together.

Before ending, we're going to set some RStudio options that will help
you out *a lot*. Go to `Tools -> Global Options...` and do these tasks:

1.  In "General", under the "Basic" tab, uncheck all boxes under "R
    Session", "Workspaces", and "History", as well as changing the "Save
    workspace to .RData on exit" to "Never".
2.  In "Code", under the "Editing" tab, change the "Tab width" to 2. The
    tidyverse style guide as well as `{styler}` both use 2 spaces for
    tabs, and since we are using the package, we can set this option
    here to save us editing issues.
3.  In "Code", under the "Saving" tab, check all the boxes under
    "General" and "Auto-save". This last one, the "Auto-save", will help
    out a lot, since one of the biggest "troubleshooting issues" we
    encounter when helping during the version control session is that
    people forget to save. This solves that problem.
