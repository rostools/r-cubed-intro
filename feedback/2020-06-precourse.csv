Questions,Responses
Please describe the problems you've had.,"I am not able to download the newest version of R on my workplace computer. I have contacted the IT department of the Capital Region, where I am working. They will not allow a newer version of R at this moment."
Please describe the problems you've had.,"I can only update the Rstudio to 1.2.5001 (the latest available version in software shop), but once I close it and open it again it returns to the previously installed version and r3 commands give an error. I have re-installed it but the problem was not solved, I am contacting work helpdesk."
Please describe the problems you've had.,I could not make the first commands because I did not have Rtools.
Please describe the problems you've had.,I didn't get the same sort of response from my commands to install packages etc. so thought that they hadn't installed correctly.
Please describe the problems you've had.,"I got many error comments while tried to instal the ""remotes"" package"
Please describe the problems you've had.,"I had a lot of read text in the R programme when running the codes, but I believe that the packages were succesfully installed at last as it said:... package ‘prodigenr’ successfully unpacked and MD5 sums checked, etc.
Please describe the problems you've had.,"I was installing GIT on my lap top, and I had to take different decisions about the required installation files, which I did not know about. A colleague helped me, but I am still not sure if have taken the right decisions. Hope that I will encounter no problems during the course."
Please describe the problems you've had.,It took me three times to install Gitlab. It said: These packages have more recent versions available. And at the end of the process it gave me errors
Please describe the problems you've had.,Please have a look at my previously answer
Please describe the problems you've had.,"we don't have administrator rights on the work computers in RegionH, so all programs need to be installed via the software/ computer center of the Region. they add requested programs to the "" softwareshop"" upon request, but that takes quite some time since they need to be checked for saftety. It is meant to help protect patient data but can make installing programs very slow."
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",...
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","Code of conduct could be shorter. I understand it is necessary, but very wordy :)"
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","Guidelines for installation of Git. I hade to go through a lot of steps. I just choose the defualt setting - and hope this is right. A note on whtether this is what should be done could be nice. And is something else should be done, this should be described."
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",Hvis linket havde virket hele tiden
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",I am satisfied
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","I cannot think of anything, everything was very clear and well structured."
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","I didn't get the exact same output in R-studio as in the GIF videos - but it seemed to work anyway. It was fine to use short GIF's to show how to do - but its a bit tricky to spot what the first step was (since the GIF just continues to run). Maybe a video-player where you can stop/play as you want would be better. (however not a big problem when the video is so short)"
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","I had to install the package 'remotes' prior to starting, which was fine, but it's not mentioned on the page (unless I missed it!). Might cause some confusion for some people who have never opened R prior to this:)"
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","I have troubles installing Gitlab, It said: These packages have more recent versions available. It it took me three attemps to do it."

"In your opinion, what could be improved?",I think it was quite straight and easy to follow.
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",I think it's good as it is.
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",I thought the pre-course material was more time demanding. Maybe I have missed something.
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","I was unsure whether earlier versions of R could be used (the newest was not available to me as an Region H employed). But got an email answer on that, so all good."
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","In the beginning I had some problems to be able to solve the tasks, because I needed to download Rtools. This was not described in chapter 2, but after some time I managed to solve the problem using the instructions in R."
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","it is a problem to install/update certain softwares in the work computer and the helpdesk does not help in such short time. In the end, everything turned out to work, but it took much longer than I predicted to complete the pre-tasks. Since this course is to apply to our work, it would be good to consider and desgn the course to be done in the work computer."
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","It was in the beginning a bit unclear what exercises I should complete and what I should save, and what was done in the course itself (e.g., the group work assignment)."
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","It would be good if the material contains a section of ""possible errors/mistakes"" during the preparation"
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","List of participants of the course (incl. institutions), maybe shared by email"
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",Maybe a phone number that you could call when all he problems comes up instead of an email adresse.
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",maybe having more pre-course tasks!
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",maybe som audio on the small videos could replace some of the text or it could be in addition to the text.

"In your opinion, what could be improved?","The code of conduct was very ""American"" style and maybe not that relevant in a Danish research setting"
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",The GIFS were cool but sometimes I couldn't tell where the start point was
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","There were a lot of different links, opening a lot of internet tabs. Sometimes it was difficult to figure out where to find what. And for those of us with system administrated computers, we really have no control over the versions of R and Rstudio"
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",You can develop a video to explain the pre-course task
"In your opinion, what worked well?",All
"In your opinion, what worked well?",All instructions were simple and easy to apply.

"In your opinion, what worked well?",It was very easy to understand what to do and follow the instructions in the pre-couse material. The small videos (eg. on to install packages) worked very well.
"In your opinion, what worked well?","Most of it - if you have right to install programs on your computer (I have but many of my collegues don't). I have R and Rstudio from our softwareshop at my working place, and the newest versions are not the newest available, but I will keep those i have from our softwareshop."

"In your opinion, what worked well?",The material for the pre-course is easy to follow
"In your opinion, what worked well?","The web-page is very well written.  However, I could not download the latest version of R. I have asked the administrators to make the latest version available but it takes several weeks to do so... I also had problems with the initial task because my computer did not have Rtools but that was solved. I hope the course will be possible even though it is not the latest version..."
