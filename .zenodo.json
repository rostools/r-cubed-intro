  "title": "Reproducible Research in R: An introductory workshop on modern data analyses and workflows",
  "description": "Reproducibility and open scientific practices are increasingly demanded of scientists and researchers. Training on how to apply these practices in data analysis has not kept up with demand. The aim of this workshop is to begin meeting that demand. The workshop is designed as a series of participatory live-coding lessons, where the instructor and learner code together, interspersed with hands-on exercises throughout the workshop, and where participants complete a final team project assignment doing a simple data analysis project.  This repository contains all of the material for the workshop, from reading material to exercises to images. It is structured as a book, with 'chapters' as lessons. For more detail on the workshop, check out the <a href='https://r-cubed-intro.rostools.org'>r-cubed-intro.rostools.org</a>.",
