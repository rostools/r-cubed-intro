Reproducibility and open scientific practices are increasingly being
requested or required of scientists and researchers, but training on
these practices has not kept pace. This 3-day workshop intends to help
bridge that gap and covers the fundamentals and workflow of data
analysis in R.

The workshop is a hands-on introduction to doing doing research that is
reproducible by using R, RStudio, Quarto, Git, and GitHub. It is
designed for doing participatory live-typing, where the teacher
demonstrates the tasks on their computer connected to a projector while
learners type along on their own computer. The workshop also includes
reading tasks, discussion activities, hands-on exercises, and a group
project.

This website contains all of the material for the workshop, including
readings, exercises, presentations, live-typing material, and images. It
is structured as a book, with "chapters" as sessions, in order of
appearance. We make heavy use of the website throughout the workshop
where "type-along" sessions almost identically follow the material on
the website (with slight modifications for time or more detailed
explanations).

Check out the overview section of the workshop, starting with the
@sec-syllabus.

If you plan on attending the workshop, please make sure to complete the
pre-workshop tasks in @sec-pre-workshop to get set up and ready for the
workshop. The pre-workshop tasks include a survey that you need to fill
out before the workshop starts.

## Target audiences

This website and its content are targeted to three groups:

1.  For the **learners** to use during the workshop, both to follow
    along and also to use as a reference after the workshop ends. A more
    detailed description of who the learner is in @sec-is-this-for-you.
2.  For the **teachers** to use as a guide for when they do the
    type-along sessions.
3.  For those who are **interested in teaching**, who may not have much
    experience or may not know where to start, to use this website as a
    guide to running and teaching their own workshops.

## How the website is made

The workshop material is created using [Quarto](https://quarto.org) to
write the material and create the book format,
[GitHub](https://github.com/) to host the [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
repository of the material, and [GitHub
Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) with
[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) to build and host the website. The

well as subsequent modifications. Here is a list of some of these
sources.

-   The [Aarhus University CRU](https://au-cru.github.io/) sessions on
    [project
    management](https://au-cru.github.io/content/workflow-setup.html),
    [data management and
    wrangling](https://au-cru.github.io/content/intro-dplyr.html),

-   [A Git
    session](https://uoftcoders.github.io/studyGroup/lessons/git/intro/lesson/),
    given for the
    [UofTCoders](https://uoftcoders.github.io/studyGroup/).
-   The [UofTCoders Intro to R course for Ecology
    students](https://uoftcoders.github.io/rcourse/).

Content from multiple sources was used as inspiration for this workshop,
including the [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) book and the
[Fundamentals of Data Visualization](https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/).

The [Danish Diabetes and Endocrinology
Academy](https://www.ddeacademy.dk/) has hosted, organized, and
sponsored running this workshop to researchers in Denmark versions
multiple times. A huge thanks to them for their involvement, support,
and sponsorship! Both [Steno Diabetes Center
Aarhus](https://www.stenoaarhus.dk/) and [Aarhus
University](https://www.au.dk/) are employers of Luke Johnston and
Daniel Witte (the initial founders and creators).
